These top 80 racers were then mentored by the ex-MotoGP racer Jeremy McWilliams & 7-time INMRC championship winning Emmanuel Jebaraj. The top 20 that made it through the demanding qualifiers pushed their limits at the MMRT, Chennai, today.

## The media race

India's top auto media also got to race on the KTM RC 390 at MMRT in a friendly race. Their presence was an added motivation for the top 20 racers who competed in the finale.

Speaking on the occasion, Jeremy McWilliams, Race Director - KTM RC CUP, said, “I’ve thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this race weekend. The feedback from the racers and their progression in the past 3 days has been truly outstanding. I am particularly pleased to see how the racers have internalised the advice I’ve offered and then delivered on track. Jeba and his team have worked hard to up the standards and got a good base setting for the racers now. The KTM Race Cup is delivering exactly what it set out to do and I am already looking forward to season 2.”

Mr Sumeet Narang, President (Probiking) at Bajaj Auto Ltd: said, “Our journey across India has been extremely fulfilling as we interacted with some of the best racers in the country who also happen to be KTM owners.

We are thrilled by the never-seen-or-heard-before participation in India by any manufacturer to date for a one-make-championship.
