### A Revolution with class-leading performance

The Harley-Davidson X440 is a true performer, delivering best-in-class value and
performance. At the heart of the Harley-Davidson X440 is the all-new 440cc oil-cooled,
long-stroke BSVI (OBD II) and E20 compliant engine, a first for Hero MotoCorp. The
engine punches a best-in-class power output of 27 bhp as well as the best-in-class
maximum torque of 38 NM. The motorcycle offers extremely flat torque curve,
generating~90% of its peak torque from as low as 2000rpm.

The engine comes with an assist and slipper clutch to offer precise control and instills
confidence in the rider. Engine refinement ensures rider comfort during long rides. The
6-speed transmission with optimized gearing allows for highway cruising and relaxed
city commuting.

### Agile and Effortless Handling

The Harley-Davidson X440 offers comfortable rider ergonomics with distinctive H-D
character. The chassis geometry ensures a relaxed, planted and confidence-inspiring
riding experience. Paired with a powerful engine, the motorcycle delivers in both urban
environments and highway touring.

The Harley-Davidson X440’s wide and flat handlebar puts the rider in a commanding
position on the bike. The seat profile ensures comfort during long rides and brings good
support under acceleration. The motorcycle offers great pillion comfort with a flat-seat
profile with adequate roominess and legroom combined with pillion grab-rails for a
comfortable holding position.

The motorcycle delivers class-leading braking performance with excellent levels of
brake power, modulation, and feel with its 320 mm front disc and 240 mm rear disc
brakes. The Dual Channel ABS ensures braking stability and precise deceleration in
varied surfaces.

A combination of 18” front and 17” rear wheels, the lightest in segment, provides a
commanding stance. The wide tyres (100/90 front and 140/70 rear) present a perfect
balance between aesthetics and performance. The unique Zig-Zag center groove design
provides effective water channeling. Designed for modern classic motorcycles, the tyres
offer performance and feedback on both dry and wet surfaces and come with a shoulder
profile that offers enhanced cornering grip.

### Stand-out Styling

With a differentiated styling that is modern and international, the Harley-Davidson
X440 lets the rider exhibit authority and command with its muscular feel and
proportions. The all-metal front fender, rear fender, fuel tank, and side covers
emphasizes the bold character of the motorcycle. The Harley-Davidson X440 carries
unmistakable Harley-Davidson styling elements like the tank design and the
uncompromising signature Harley-Davidson exhaust note. The motorcycle comes with a
first-in-segment seamless fuel tank for enhanced aesthetics.

Retaining the premium genes of the brand, the Harley-Davidson X440 comes with an
advance lighting package to offer better road visibility and low power consumption.
