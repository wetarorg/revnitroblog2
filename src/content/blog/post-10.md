**Modern tail lamp with new split grab rail**, **wave disk brake* along with alloy wheels, fresh new graphics and bold new logo** further accentuate the sporty character of the moto-scooter making it an irresistible choice.

### **ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY**

**Smart Key* with H-Smart technology:** Further adding smartness to the sporty Dio 125 is the globally acclaimed Honda Smart Key that comes with following features:

1. **Smart Find**: Answer back system that assists in easily locating the vehicle. When the answer back button is pressed on the Honda SMART Key, all 4 winkers blink twice to locate the scooter.
2. **Smart Unlock:** It allows to lock and unlock the vehicle without using a physical key. In case the system detects no activity for 20 seconds after activation, the scooter automatically gets deactivated.
3. **Smart Start:** If the smart key is within the range of 2 meters of the vehicle, then rider can unlock seat, fuel cap and handle or smoothly start the vehicle by rotating the knob on the Loc Mod (5-in-1 function switch) without even taking out the key.
4. **Smart Safe:** Dio 125 is equipped with Mapped SMART ECU which acts as a security device by electronically matching (ID) between the ECU and SMART Key, therefore preventing vehicle theft. The smart key has an immobilizer system which prevents a non-registered key from starting the engine. Without secure connection with Smart Key, Immobilizer System is not activated.

The OBD2 compliant Dio 125 is packed with Honda’s trusted 125cc **PGM-FI** engine boosted by **Honda Enhanced Smart Power (eSP).** A performance accelerator to the engine, Honda Enhanced Smart Power (eSP) technology optimizes energy output by maximizing efficient combustion and minimizing friction with a silent start & a smooth eco-friendly engine.

**Enhanced Smart Power (eSP)** is an integration of the following:

- **Unique Honda ACG Starter**: It starts engine jolt free via the same AC generator used to generate current and charge the battery while riding. This eliminates the need for a conventional starter motor, thus, there are no gear meshing noises.
- **Improvised tumble flow:** Honda developed the world’s first tumble flow technology through integrated die-casting process. It produces tumble flow by optimizing inlet port shape and using reverse flow phenomenon, without adding additional components leading to combustion improvisation and low fuel consumption.
- **Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI):** It injects the right amount of fuel in cylinder based on specific engine data and constant feedback from the **6 intelligent sensors** (Engine oil temperature sensor, Engine Speed sensor, Oxygen sensor, Air pressure sensor, Air temperature sensor, Throttle Position Sensor) resulting in smooth and linear power output throughout.
- **Friction Reduction & Improved Combustion:** Offset cylinder, compact weight crankshaft & piston reduce overall engine friction. Optimized weight results in improved fuel efficiency. The **piston cooling jet** improves cooling efficiency & maintains optimum engine temperature leading to improved fuel efficiency.
- **The Solenoid Valve**: It acts as an automatic choke system which ensures rich air fuel mixture and provides the convenience of one time start at any point of time.

**Fully Digital Meter is intelligent and displays all the advanced information.** It provides 3 real time informatics - **Range** (displays distance one can travel with existing fuel in tank), **Average Fuel Efficiency** (for overall fuel efficiency display) & **Real-time Fuel Efficiency** for a rich riding experience. The meter displays details like Trip, Clock, Side Stand indicator, Smart key & battery indicator*, ECO indicator and Service Due indicator with **malfunction light** which alerts the rider in case of serious malfunctions in the vehicle which need immediate attention.

The Dio 125 comes with **Idling Stop System** that automatically switches the engine off at the traffic light and other brief stops, eliminating unnecessary fuel consumption and resulting in lesser emission. Engine can easily be re-started with a simple twist of the throttle. **Side Stand with Engine Inhibitor** prevents engine start while the side stand is engaged enabling a convenient and carefree ride.

### **COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE**

The moto-scooter gets **Telescopic Suspension with a** **12-inch front wheel with** that gives a clean and stylish appearance along with better maneuverability resulting in a smoother ride over rough roads. Its high ground clearance (171 mm) helps in crossing challenging rough roads with ease and confidence.

Making every ride on new Dio 125 a comfortable and convenient experience is the **Combi-Brake System (CBS) with Equalizer** and **3-step adjustable rear suspension**. It also comes equipped with a unique **dual function switch** for unlocking the seat & opening external fuel lid offering extra level of comfort to the rider. It also comes equipped with a unique **Two Lid Fuel Opening System** which ensures maximum convenience and reliability to the rider.

The **18L storage space** has been designed to optimise the space and accommodate a little more stuff apart from helmet. The Dio 125 gets a **front pocket** which provides an easily accessible storage option for a hassle-free riding experience. **Integrated headlamp beam & passing switch** provides the convenience of controlling high beam/low beam & passing signal with a flick of a finger.

The H-Smart variant comes with a **Lock Mod** which facilitates 5 in 1 function (lock handle, ignition OFF, fuel lid open, seat open & ignition ON) without the need to insert physical key.
