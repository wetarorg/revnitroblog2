Commenting on the launch, Mr. Vinay Pant, Head-Marketing, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd., said: “Building further on our success with the Altroz iCNG, and to make the CNG segment even more hotly contested, we are excited to introduce the twin cylinder technology in not just one but three products today – the Tiago, Tigor and the much awaited and loved sub compact SUV, the Tata Punch. Since its debut at the Auto Expo 2023, the Punch iCNG has been one of the most awaited products in this segment. With its uncompromised boot space and high end feature upgrades, the Punch iCNG demonstrates the go anywhere attitude of an SUV, which is engineered to meet the constantly evolving requirements of customers, who are tech savvy and demand best in class features along with an environment friendly and economical product. I am confident that these introductions put together will make our CNG line up appealing, holistic and stronger than ever.” 
About the Punch iCNG:
With multiple milestones to its credit, the Punch has been successful in creating its own mark. And now equipped with the most innovative CNG technology in the country and exquisite features, this Punch goes far and beyond.   
OMG! it’s Safe!
The Punch iCNG is built on the modern ALFA Architecture platform that has been proven for safety by receiving the 5-Star Global NCAP adult safety rating at the time of launch.
Extensive use of ultra-high strength steel and reinforced body structure provides rigidity to the car and makes it robust. 
Further enhanced safety features like a micro-switch to keep the car switched off at the time of refuelling.
Thermal incident protection cuts off CNG supply to the engine and releases gas into the atmosphere as a measure of safety.
The twin cylinders located below the luggage area offer the safest solution as the valves and pipes are protected under the load floor minimizing the risk of potential damage. Additionally the enhanced rear body structure and 6 point mounting system for the CNG tanks provide additional rear crash safety for the Punch iCNG.
