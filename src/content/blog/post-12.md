## **TRIUMPH’S ICONIC SPEED AND SCRAMBLER DESIGN DNA**

Conceived and designed in Hinckley, UK, these two new additions to the modern classics line-up have been developed with the same exacting attention to detail as Triumph’s most celebrated models. They are instantly recognisable thanks to their timeless Triumph silhouettes, signature sculpted fuel tanks and classic engine profiles and have been designed to deliver all of the quality, feel and presence of their larger capacity stablemates.

Traditional touches, like the distinctive finned cylinder head and traditional exhaust header clamps combine with contemporary details like the upswept silencer, bold graphics and sensitively-incorporated technology, such as concealed liquid-cooling and a flowing exhaust run with a hidden primary silencer. All combine to deliver that unmistakable Triumph modern classic style.

The high-quality finish and elegant detailing continues with the trademark black powder-coated engine casings, tough gold anodised forks, high-quality paint and logo detailing which ensure the finish on these new models is premium throughout.

The Speed 400’s two-tone paint schemes, each featuring a prominent Triumph tank graphic, reflect its dynamic roadster style, with Carnival Red, Caspian Blue and Phantom Black colours available.

Accentuating the Scrambler 400 X’s all-road attitude are lots of purposeful and practical features, including protection for the headlight, radiator and sump, as well as handguards, a handlebar brace with pad and a longer front mudguard.

The Scrambler 400 X is available in three stylish and contemporary colour schemes, each featuring Triumph’s distinctive ‘Scrambler’ tank stripe and triangle badge, with Matt Khaki Green and Fusion White, Carnival Red and Phantom Black, plus Phantom Black and Silver Ice options.

## **THE ALL-NEW TR-SERIES ENGINE**

Named to celebrate the historic Triumph ‘Trophy’ bloodline, whose roots can be traced back to the racing singles of the early twentieth century, and in particular Six Day Trial offroad competition. This all-new fuel-injected and liquid-cooled 398cc single-cylinder engine combines Triumph’s trademark modern classic style with state-of-the-art engineering to deliver class-beating performance with a responsive, fun and characterful power delivery along with an evocative, rich and distinctive exhaust note.

Technical highlights include a four-valve, DOHC cylinder head and a crankshaft that has been perfectly weighted and balanced to optimise inertia for low-speed rideability. A finger-follower valvetrain with a low reciprocating mass and DLC coatings that reduce friction also contribute to this free-revving yet tractable engine’s capacity-defying performance.

The six-speed gearbox delivers light, precise gear selection with ratios perfectly spread to make the most of this characterful and torque-rich engine.

### **Key features of this all-new engine include:**

## **TRIUMPH’S EASY, AGILE AND DYNAMIC CONFIDENCE-INSPIRING RIDE**

With ergonomics designed for optimum comfort and control, the Speed 400 and Scrambler 400 X benefit from a slim waistline which combines with an accessible seat height of 790mm and 835mm respectively and a low weight of 170kg / 179kg to ensure assured low-speed handling and easy feet-down manoeuvres.

Both models benefit from their own model-specific chassis set-up, with a new frame, bolt-on rear subframe and cast-aluminium swingarm paired with suspension set-ups tailored to each use case, both delivering Triumph’s famously easy, agile and dynamic handling.

The Speed 400 features large 43mm big-piston upside-down front forks, a mono-shock Rear Suspension Unit with external reservoir, lightweight 17-inch wheels and roadster-specific geometry and wheelbase. The features provide an engaging and intuitive ride along with a comfortable, neutral riding position that inspires confidence for riders of all sizes and skill levels. Powerful four-piston radial front brakes with a 300mm front disc and braided lines give a responsive brake feel for improved rider confidence.

The Scrambler 400 X features a longer wheelbase, longer travel suspension, larger 19-inch front wheel and wide handlebars for greater stability and control when riding on loose surfaces, as well as providing a more upright and commanding Scrambler riding position. A larger cast steel brake pedal and high-grip foot pegs that are positioned lower and wider also make for a more natural standing riding position when riding off-road, while a larger 320mm front brake disc and optimised pad compound deliver reassuringly progressive braking performance in all conditions.

Bosch engine management with ride-by-wire throttle delivers a linear and intuitive throttle response with predictable power delivery for enhanced rideability, safety and control.

All this functionality is accessed via an intuitive easy to use handlebar-mounted scroll button, and the display is even pre-enabled to show the status of accessory fitted heated grips, if fitted. A conveniently located USB-C charging socket allows on-the-move charging of handlebar mounted devices, such as smartphones and navigation systems.
