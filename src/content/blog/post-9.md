The motorcycle’s **bold tank design** paired with sporty shrouds presents a powerful amalgamation of fierceness and vitality. The sporty nature of the motorcycle is further emphasized by its **aerodynamic under cowl**. The **bold LED Headlamp** grants it a premium aesthetic, while the bold design of the **LED Tail lamp** confers an exceptional identity.

Further adding sportier demeanor to the all-new SP160 is its **130mm wide rear tyre** which provides improved traction during acceleration. The inclusion of a **sporty** **muffler with a chrome covering** amplifies the stylish & sporty DNA of the motorcycle.

### **ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY**

At the core of SP160 lies the **OBD2 compliant** Honda’s mid-size advanced 160cc **Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) engine** that provides improved performance and an unparalleled level of fuel efficiency.

The **Solenoid valve** in engine acts as an automatic choke mechanism during engine start and warmup. It provides extra air to the engine at the time of ignition and when the engine is warming up. The opening and closing of the solenoid valve are regulated by the Engine Control Unit (ECU) depending on the engine oil temperature and pressure of intake air.

The **advanced & efficient engine** is designed with a long stroke that provides extra torque and superior efficiency. The **high compression ratio** of 10:1 contributes to powerful performance of the motorcycle.

To enhance cooling capabilities and minimize distortion of the inner cylinder, **spiny sleeves** have been integrated into the outer surface. The implementation of a **roller rocker arm** ensures seamless power delivery and minimizes frictional losses.

Additionally, the inclusion of a **counterweight balancer** decreases vibrations and facilitates seamless acceleration from low rpm to high rpm range.

Its **advanced digital meter** keeps the rider updated with all the information on the go. The meter displays details like Clock, Service due indicator, Gear position indicator, side stand indicator, Fuel gauge and other mileage related information such as average fuel mileage, fuel consumption and average speed.

### **COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE**

The all new SP160 is equipped with single channel **ABS (Anti-brake system)** that gives an enhanced braking performance on the roads. It effectively prevents the wheels from locking up in emergency situations or on slippery surfaces, thus ensuring greater sense of confidence while riding. The **petal disc brake** dissipates heat effectively which improves the overall braking efficiency. A combination of Front & Rear* disc brakes provides effective braking and better control.

The high-performance **Rear Mono Shock** suspension is housed below the seat and mounted on the advanced tough and flexible diamond frame. It offers superior riding comfort and excellent stability.

Its high ground clearance (177mm) prevents engine & frame hitting surface on uneven roads. The **longer & spacious seat** (594mm) provides comfortable ride experience to both rider as well as pillion. Its long wheelbase (1347mm) gives stability & comfortable riding experience.

The SP160 comes with **Engine Stop Switch** for the convenience of turning-off the engine at signals and other brief stops with the flick of a button. Additionally, it has a **hazard switch** which is a critical safety component that activates the flashing indicator lights, playing a vital role in emergency stops and poor visibility conditions.
